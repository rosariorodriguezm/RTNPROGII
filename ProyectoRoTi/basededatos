Season 2 of True detective not worth even a 5 of rating.) Also people are voting in the top 50/100 list. Result.... They vote for the same serie over and over. Rise the popularity of the already top 100 series which are old reviews from the first season. Result Series with a slow introduction of all characters in the first season are totally eclipsed.

I am not one to judge too quickly and I thought the series might be a slow burner - but sadly it was a dud with Spielberg\'s dead formulaic hand all over it. I had enjoyed the first few series but the later ones rather than building on the earlier efforts are just hideous. There are so many unbelievable events, not just physically unbelievable but emotionally and logically.\nIt is an unholy mess driving onwards to a climax I don\'t care about anymore. This is a bad series, with no real development of the characters. Some of the leads, who are very good actors try their best - but it\'s not enough. When it comes down to it, the reason why this is a pile of chowder is the fault of the great fish head who made his name with another fish.
